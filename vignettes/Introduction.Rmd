In this vignette, we give an overview of the mathematical model of RSV transmission, and how to run the model using this package.

## Model structure
The model is an adapted version of an susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) deterministic, ordinary differential equation (ODE) model outlined in: 

Hogan, A. B., Campbell, P. T., Blyth, C. C., Lim, F. J., Fathima, P., Davis, S., ... & Glass, K. (2017). Potential impact of a maternal vaccine for RSV: a mathematical modelling study. Vaccine, 35(45), 6172-6179, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.09.043>,

Nazareno, A. L., Newall, A. T., Muscatello, D. J., Hogan, A. B., & Wood, J. G. (2024). Modelling the epidemiological impact of maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination in Australia. Vaccine, 42(26), 126418, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.126418>.

In brief, the model is age-structured and primary (the first) and secondary infections (any subsequent infection) are specifically tracked. The age-specific force of infection is determined by a seasonal forcing function and the age-specific contact matrix (the mean contact per person).

## Contact matrix
Contact matrices can be obtained within the package using the POLYMOD data (<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050074>). To do so, the socialmixr (<https://epiforecasts.io/socialmixr/>) package is used to obtain the contact matrix for the age groupings of the given age limits that are integers. The contact matrix is calculated such that the total contacts in the population (assuming population data from ) are symmetric.
