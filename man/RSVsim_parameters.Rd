\usage{
RSVsim_parameters(
  overrides = list(),
  contact_population_list,
  fitted_parameter_names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{overrides}{List of default parameters to change.}

\item{contact_population_list}{List of outputs from the \code{create_contact_matrix} function.}

\item{fitted_parameter_names}{Vector of parameter names to exclude from the list because they are fitted. Default: \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
Parameter list. Default values: \cr
\code{b0}: 0.08. Transmission rate coefficient. \cr
\code{b1}: 0. Amplitude of seasonal forcing in the transmission rate. \cr
\code{phi}: 0. Phase shift of the seasonal forcing. \cr
\code{delta}: 1/4. Inverse of the latent period. \cr
\code{gamma_s}: 1/8. Inverse of the infectious period of subsequent (secondary) infections. \cr
\code{gamma_p}: 1/9. Inverse of the infectious period of first (primary) infections. \cr
\code{nu}: 1/200. Inverse of the duration of natural immunity. \cr
\code{omega_vect}: 0.35 if less than 5 years old else 1. Reduced infectiousness due to immunity in early life. \cr
\code{prop_detected_vect}: age-specific proportion detected. \cr
\code{sigma_vect}: 0.7 if 1 months old, 0.8 if 2 months old, 0.9 if 3 months old, else 1. Reduced susceptibility due to immunity in early life. \cr
\code{alpha_vect} = 0.4 if less than 10 years old else 0.3. Reduced susceptibility to secondary infections in each age group. \cr
\code{nAges}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Number of age groups - same length as age.limits. \cr
\code{age.limits}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Lower age limits in years. \cr
\code{matrix_mean}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Contact matrix of mean contacts per person. \cr
\code{max_age}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Maximum age in years. \cr
\code{age_chr}: Age limits as a character vector. \cr
\code{size_cohorts}: the differences in ages in days - used to calculate the size of the cohorts. \cr
\code{rel_sizes}: the relative size of each cohort (age category duration in days divided by the total number of days). \cr
\code{total_population}: 1861923. Total population size. \cr
\code{Sp0, Ss0, Ep0, Es0, Ip0, Is0, R0, Incidence0}: initial conditions to run the model for each compartment - these are given as prevalence and the initial conditions calculated in this function. List. Default: \code{NULL}.
