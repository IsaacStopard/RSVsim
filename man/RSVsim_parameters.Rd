\item{contact_population_list}{List of outputs from the \code{create_contact_matrix} function.}
}
\value{
Parameter list. Default values: \cr
\code{b0}: 0.08. Transmission rate coefficient. \cr
\code{b1}: 0. Amplitude of seasonal forcing in the transmission rate. \cr
\code{phi}: 0. Phase shift of the seasonal forcing. \cr
\code{delta}: 1/4. Inverse of the latent period. \cr
\code{gamma_s}: 1/8. Inverse of the infectious period of subsequent (secondary) infections. \cr
\code{gamma_p}: 1/9. Inverse of the infectious period of first (primary) infections. \cr
\code{nu}: 1/200. Inverse of the duration of natural immunity. \cr
\code{omega_vect}: 0.35 if greater than 5 years old else 1. Reduced infectiousness due to immunity in early life. \cr
\code{prop_detected_vect}: age-specific proportion detected. \cr
\code{sigma_vect}: 0.7 if 1 months old, 0.8 if 2 months old, 0.9 if 3 months old, else 1. Reduced susceptibility due to immunity in early life. \cr
\code{alpha_vect} = 0.4 if less than 10 years old else 0.3. Reduced susceptibility to secondary infections in each age group. \cr
\code{nAges}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Number of age groups - same length as age.limits. \cr
\code{age.limits}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Lower age limits in years. \cr
\code{matrix_per_person}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Contact matrix of mean contacts per person. \cr
\code{max_age}: must be obtained from \code{contact_population_list}. Maximum age in years. \cr
\code{age_chr}: Age limits as a character vector. \cr
\code{size_cohorts}: the differences in ages in days - used to calculate the size of the cohorts. \cr
\code{rel_sizes}: the relative size of each cohort (age category duration in days divided by the total number of days). \cr
\code{total_population}: 1861923. Total population size. \cr
\code{nVaccStates}: 2. Number of vaccination states. Default: 1: unvaccinated, 2: vaccinated. Minimum is 2. \cr
\code{gamma_vaccine}: 1 / (365*2). Rate of waning between vaccinated states. Size of vector must be nVaccStates minus one. \cr
\code{nVaccTimes}: 5. Length of start times of vaccination distributions. \cr
\code{vaccine_times}: c(0, 365.25, 365.25 + 30, 730.5, 730.5 + 30). Times of vaccination distributions. First time should be 0. \cr
\code{vaccine_period}: rep(30, 5). Duration of vaccination distributions.
\code{vaccine_cov}: matrix with the rows corresponding to the vaccine_times and the columns corresponding to the ages. \cr
Age-specific proportion of unvaccinated people to have been vaccinated by the end of the vaccination distribution for each \code{vaccine_time},
assuming no waning of vaccination. The vaccination rate is calculated as \code{-log(1 - vaccine_cov) / vaccine_period}. Default is 0 coverage for all ages.
Changes in effective coverage with are given as a model output.  \cr
\code{VE}: 0.85 for all ages and vaccinated states. Vaccine efficacy for each age group and vaccinated state. Number of rows must be equal to the number of age groups,
and the number of columns should be equal to nVaccStates - 1. \cr
\code{Sp0, Ss0, Ep0, Es0, Ip0, Is0, R0, Incidence0, doses0}: initial conditions to run the model for each compartment -
these are given as prevalence and the initial conditions calculated in this function. List. Default: \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}: 0.1\% RSV prevalence is assumed for people during the primary infection, which is seeded at the beginning of the simulation.
All other people are assumed to be susceptible to their primary infection.
