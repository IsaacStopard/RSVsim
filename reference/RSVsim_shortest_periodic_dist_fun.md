# Distance function to calculate the shortest periodic difference between two vectors.

Calculates the absolute distance between two times when the times are
circular. Vectorised.

## Usage

``` r
RSVsim_shortest_periodic_dist_fun(target, target_star, period)
```

## Arguments

- target:

  First vector of metrics.

- target_star:

  Second vector of metrics.

- period:

  Cosine wave period.

## Value

Absolute difference.
